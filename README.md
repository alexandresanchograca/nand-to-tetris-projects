# nand-to-tetris-projects

My nand to tetris project solutions.

The overall course objective is to make a computer from scratch that was able to run tetris.

I took the course on cousera, following the videos while also reading the book The Elements of Computing Systems.
Highly recommend the course.

The code presented here is not great, or even good, but it was frustrating and fun to write. :)
