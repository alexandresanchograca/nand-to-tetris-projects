# nand-to-tetris-projects

All my nand to tetris project solutions.

The overall course objective is to make a computer from scratch that was able to run tetris.

I took the course on cousera, mainly by following the videos while also reading the book The Elements of Computing Systems.
Highly recommend the course. The first part is pretty acessible to all skill levels. I found the second part much, much more demanding.

The code presented here is not great, or even good, but it was frustrating and fun to write. :)
